#The model provides data from the database.

#In Django, the data is delivered as an Object Relational Mapping (ORM),
# which is a technique designed to make it easier to work with databases.

#The most common way to extract data from a database is SQL. One problem with SQL is that you 
#have to have a pretty good understanding of the database structure to be able to work with it.

#Django, with ORM, makes it easier to communicate with the database
# without having to write complex SQL statements.

#The models are usually located in a file called models.py.
